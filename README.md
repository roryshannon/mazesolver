# mazesolver
My NEA computing project maze solver

currently concentrating on:
maze solving using first a 'wall follower', and then 'tremauxs' algortihm (a form of depth first traversal)

I may implement dijkstras BFS later on but this isnt part of my project so may not happemn for a number of months

all part of my A-level NEA project which has an accompanying word document which dteails the process in depth and on which I will be marked.


I have completeed my wall follower and DFS tremuaxs

I need to work towards a completed GUI
