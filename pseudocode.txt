My Trumeauxs algorithm must:
	Junction?
		No: Go forward

		Yes: Any paths in visited?
            No: Choose and mark path

            Yes: any paths not in vivisted?
                No: deadend turn around

	            Yes: choose and mark path 



Tremauxs code:
    if there is a junction: 

        if any of the connections are NOT in visited:
            choose it
            mark as visited 
            move to next square
        else if all squares have been visited:
            turn around as this is a deadend

        
    else:
        go forward



everytime you arrive at a junction
is connection 1 in visited?
is 2?
is 3?
until you find the one that isnt
If they all are then turn around!


Tremauxshit is this code?

    if connections > 2: 
            
        for i in range self.connections
            if self.connections[i] not in visited:
                current_square = next_square
                visited.append(current_square)
                
                break
                

            elif all squares visited #if all connections are in vivisted
            deadend code
            

    else:
        current_square = current_square + forward
