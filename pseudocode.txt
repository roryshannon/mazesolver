Tremauxs algorithm
go to next square, place in visited

if unvisited squares

visit them 

if node has no unvisited squares, it is explored and should be treated as a dead

need to use: stack for order of the ndoes visited as you pastt through them!

and a list of visited nodes, but inclides ALL nodes!



for each square, when you visit it, set its visited value to True, add it to the stack, when all its ndoes are visited it is explored

and keep a stack of the visited nodes, upon visitng add to stack, when explored pop off the stack // pop off the stack and set as explored

and keep an order of all nodes so we know which way you have gone
